  abstract  = {Localization is a key part of an autonomous system, such as a self-driving car. The main sensor for the task is the GNSS, however its limitations can be eliminated only by integrating other methods, for example wheel odometry, which requires a well-calibrated model. This paper proposes a novel wheel odometry model and its calibration. The parameters of the nonlinear dynamic system are estimated with Gauss–Newton regression. Due to only automotive-grade sensors are applied to reach a cost-effective system, the measurement uncertainty highly corrupts the estimation accuracy. The problem is handled with a unique Kalman-filter addition to the iterative loop. The experimental results illustrate that without the proposed improvements, in particular the dynamic wheel assumption and integrated filtering, the model cannot be calibrated precisely. With the well-calibrated odometry, the localization accuracy improves significantly and the system can be used as a cost-effective motion estimation sensor in autonomous functions.},

  abstract  = {We describe the use of multiple wide-angle sonar range measurements to map the surroundings of an autonomous mobile robot. A sonar range reading provides information concerning empty and occupied volumes in a cone (subtending 30 degrees in our case) in front of the sensor. The reading is modelled as probability profiles projected onto a raslerized map, where somewhere occupied and everywhere empty areas are represented Range measurements from multiple points of view (taken from multiple sensors on the robot, and from the same sensors after robot moves) are systematically integrated in the map. Overlapping empty volumes re-inforce each other, and serve to condense the range of occupied volumes. The map definition improves as more readings are added. The final map shows regions probably occupied, probably unoccupied, and unknown areas. The method deals effectively with clutter, and can be used for motion planning and for extended landmark recognition. This system has been tested on the Neptune mobile robot at CMU.},

  abstract = {Recently, Rao-Blackwellized particle filters (RBPF) have been introduced as an effective means to solve the simultaneous localization and mapping problem. This approach uses a particle filter in which each particle carries an individual map of the environment. Accordingly, a key question is how to reduce the number of particles. In this paper, we present adaptive techniques for reducing this number in a RBPF for learning grid maps. We propose an approach to compute an accurate proposal distribution, taking into account not only the movement of the robot, but also the most recent observation. This drastically decreases the uncertainty about the robot's pose in the prediction step of the filter. Furthermore, we present an approach to selectively carry out resampling operations, which seriously reduces the problem of particle depletion. Experimental results carried out with real mobile robots in large-scale indoor, as well as outdoor, environments illustrate the advantages of our methods over previous approaches. © 2007 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Machine learning methods are often applied to the problem of learning a map from a robot's sensor data, but they are rarely applied to the problem of learning a robot's motion model. The motion model, which can be influenced by robot idiosyncrasies and terrain properties, is a crucial aspect of current algorithms for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). In this paper we concentrate on generating the correct motion model for a robot by applying EM methods in conjunction with a current SLAM algorithm. In contrast to previous calibration approaches, we not only estimate the mean of the motion, but also the interdependencies between motion terms, and the variances in these terms. This can be used to provide a more focused proposal distribution to a particle filter used in a SLAM algorithm, which can reduce the resources needed for localization while decreasing the chance of losing track of the robot's position. We validate this approach by recovering a good motion model despite initialization with a poor one. Further experiments validate the generality of the learned model in similar circumstances.},

  abstract = {This short paper presents the application of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) to the problem of mobile robot navigation in a known environment. We have developed an algorithm for model-based localization that relies on the concept of a geometric beacon—a naturally occurring environment feature that can be reliably observed in successive sensor measurements and can be accurately described in terms of a concise geometric parameterization. The algorithm is based on an EKF that utilizes matches between observed geometric beacons and an a priori map of beacon locations. We describe two implementations of this navigation algorithm, both of which use sonar. The first implementation uses a simple vehicle with point kinematics equipped with a single rotating sonar. The second implementation uses a “Robuter” mobile robot and employs six static sonar transducers to provide localization information while the vehicle moves at typical speeds of 30 cm/s. © 1991 IEEE},

  abstract = {In this paper, the problem of localising a robot within a known two-dimensional environment is formulated as one of minimising the Chamfer Distance between the corresponding occupancy grid map and information gathered from a sensor such as a laser range finder. It is shown that this nonlinear optimisation problem can be solved efficiently and that the resulting localisation algorithm has a number of attractive characteristics when compared with the conventional particle filter based solution for robot localisation in occupancy grids. The proposed algorithm is able to perform well even when robot odometry is unavailable, insensitive to noise models and does not critically depend on any tuning parameters. Experimental results based on a number of public domain datasets as well as data collected by the authors are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {The main contribution of this paper is an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based framework for mobile robot localisation in occupancy grid maps (OGMs), when the initial location is approximately known. We propose that the observation equation be formulated using the unsigned distance transform based Chamfer Distance (CD) that corresponds to a laser scan placed within the OGM, as a constraint. This formulation provides an alternative to the ray-casting model, which generally limited localisation in OGMs to Particle Filter (PF) based frameworks that can efficiently deal with observation models that are not analytic. Usage of an EKF is attractive due to its computational efficiency, especially as it can be applied to modern day field robots with limited on-board computing power. Furthermore, well-developed tools for dealing with potential outliers in the observations or changes to the motion model, exists in the EKF framework. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using a number of simulation and real life examples, including one in a dynamic environment populated with people.},
