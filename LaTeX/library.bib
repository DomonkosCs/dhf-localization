  abstract  = {Localization is a key part of an autonomous system, such as a self-driving car. The main sensor for the task is the GNSS, however its limitations can be eliminated only by integrating other methods, for example wheel odometry, which requires a well-calibrated model. This paper proposes a novel wheel odometry model and its calibration. The parameters of the nonlinear dynamic system are estimated with Gauss–Newton regression. Due to only automotive-grade sensors are applied to reach a cost-effective system, the measurement uncertainty highly corrupts the estimation accuracy. The problem is handled with a unique Kalman-filter addition to the iterative loop. The experimental results illustrate that without the proposed improvements, in particular the dynamic wheel assumption and integrated filtering, the model cannot be calibrated precisely. With the well-calibrated odometry, the localization accuracy improves significantly and the system can be used as a cost-effective motion estimation sensor in autonomous functions.},

  abstract  = {We describe the use of multiple wide-angle sonar range measurements to map the surroundings of an autonomous mobile robot. A sonar range reading provides information concerning empty and occupied volumes in a cone (subtending 30 degrees in our case) in front of the sensor. The reading is modelled as probability profiles projected onto a raslerized map, where somewhere occupied and everywhere empty areas are represented Range measurements from multiple points of view (taken from multiple sensors on the robot, and from the same sensors after robot moves) are systematically integrated in the map. Overlapping empty volumes re-inforce each other, and serve to condense the range of occupied volumes. The map definition improves as more readings are added. The final map shows regions probably occupied, probably unoccupied, and unknown areas. The method deals effectively with clutter, and can be used for motion planning and for extended landmark recognition. This system has been tested on the Neptune mobile robot at CMU.},

  abstract = {Recently, Rao-Blackwellized particle filters (RBPF) have been introduced as an effective means to solve the simultaneous localization and mapping problem. This approach uses a particle filter in which each particle carries an individual map of the environment. Accordingly, a key question is how to reduce the number of particles. In this paper, we present adaptive techniques for reducing this number in a RBPF for learning grid maps. We propose an approach to compute an accurate proposal distribution, taking into account not only the movement of the robot, but also the most recent observation. This drastically decreases the uncertainty about the robot's pose in the prediction step of the filter. Furthermore, we present an approach to selectively carry out resampling operations, which seriously reduces the problem of particle depletion. Experimental results carried out with real mobile robots in large-scale indoor, as well as outdoor, environments illustrate the advantages of our methods over previous approaches. © 2007 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Machine learning methods are often applied to the problem of learning a map from a robot's sensor data, but they are rarely applied to the problem of learning a robot's motion model. The motion model, which can be influenced by robot idiosyncrasies and terrain properties, is a crucial aspect of current algorithms for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). In this paper we concentrate on generating the correct motion model for a robot by applying EM methods in conjunction with a current SLAM algorithm. In contrast to previous calibration approaches, we not only estimate the mean of the motion, but also the interdependencies between motion terms, and the variances in these terms. This can be used to provide a more focused proposal distribution to a particle filter used in a SLAM algorithm, which can reduce the resources needed for localization while decreasing the chance of losing track of the robot's position. We validate this approach by recovering a good motion model despite initialization with a poor one. Further experiments validate the generality of the learned model in similar circumstances.},

We have developed an algorithm for model-based localization that relies on the concept of a geometric beacon—a naturally occurring environment feature that can be reliably observed in successive sensor measurements and can be accurately described in terms of a concise geometric parameterization. The algorithm is based on an EKF that utilizes matches between observed geometric beacons and an a priori map of beacon locations. We describe two implementations of this navigation algorithm, both of which use sonar. The first implementation uses a simple vehicle with point kinematics equipped with a single rotating sonar. The second implementation uses a “Robuter” mobile robot and employs six static sonar transducers to provide localization information while the vehicle moves at typical speeds of 30 cm/s. © 1991 IEEE},

We propose that the observation equation be formulated using the unsigned distance transform based Chamfer Distance (CD) that corresponds to a laser scan placed within the OGM, as a constraint. This formulation provides an alternative to the ray-casting model, which generally limited localisation in OGMs to Particle Filter (PF) based frameworks that can efficiently deal with observation models that are not analytic. Usage of an EKF is attractive due to its computational efficiency, especially as it can be applied to modern day field robots with limited on-board computing power. Furthermore, well-developed tools for dealing with potential outliers in the observations or changes to the motion model, exists in the EKF framework. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using a number of simulation and real life examples, including one in a dynamic environment populated with people.},

  abstract = {In the field of photogrammetry, computer vision and robotics recursive estimation of time dependent processes is an important task. Usually Kalman filter based techniques are used which rely on explicit model functions that directly and explicitly describe the effect of the parameters on the observations. However, some problems naturally result in implicit constraints between the observations and the parameters, for instance all those resulting in homogeneous equation systems. By implicit we mean that the constraints are given by equations that are not easily solvable for the observation vector. We propose an iterative extended Kalman filter based on implicit measurement equations. The derived filter is useful for various applications, where the possibility to use implicit constraints simplifies the modeling. As an extension, we introduce a robustification technique similar to TrNG et al. (2007) and HUBER (1981) which down-weights the influence of potential outliers. The feasibility of the proposed framework is demonstrated at a number of typical computer vision applications. © 2013 E. Schweizerbart'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung, Stuttgart, Germany.},

These random variables are often called random numbers for simplicity. However, this "simple-sounding" task is not easily achievable on a computer. But even if it were possible, it might not be desirable to use authentic random numbers because of the need to debug computer programs. In debugging a program, we often have to repeat the same computation many times; this require us to reproduce the same sequence of random numbers repeatedly. What becomes an accepted alternative in the community of scientific computing is to generate pseudo-random numbers. More formally, we can define a uniform pseudo-random number generator as an algorithm which, starting from an initial value u0 (i.e., the seed), produces a sequence (u;) = (Di(u0)) of values in [0,1]. For all n, the values (u1 , ... , un) should reproduce the behavior of an i.i.d. sample (V1 , ... , Vn) of uniform random variables. A few very good pseudo-random number generators are available; we refer the reader to Marsaglia and Zaman (1993) and Knuth (1997) for further reference. Consequently, we assume from now on that uniform random variables can be satisfactorily produced on the computer. The following simple lemma enables us to produce nonuniform random variables.

The main issue with PF is the large computational complexity. In particular, for typical low dimensional tracking problems, the PF requires 2 to 6 orders of magnitude more computer throughput than the extended Kalman filter, to achieve the same accuracy. It has been asserted that the PF avoids the curse of dimensionality, but there is no formula or theorem that bounds or, approximates the computational complexity of the PF as a function of dimension (d). In this paper, we derive a simple back-of-the-envelope formula that explains why a carefully designed PF should mitigate the curse of dimensionality for certain filtering problems, but the PF does not avoid the curse of dimensionality in general. We also show experimental results which confii our simple formula. We consider this a triumph of theory.

               promising avenue to avoid weight degeneracy; particles drawn from the prior

  abstract  = {We derive a new algorithm for computing Bayes’
               rule using particle flow that has zero curvature. The flow is
               computed by solving a vector Riccati equation exactly in
               closed form rather than solving a PDE, with a significant
               reduction in computational complexity. Our theory is valid
               for any smooth nowhere vanishing probability densities,
               including highly multimodal non-Gaussian densities. We
               show that this new flow is similar to the extended Kalman
               filter in the special case of nonlinear measurements with
               Gaussian noise. We also outline more general particle flows,
               including: constant curvature, geodesic flow, non-constant
               curvature, piece-wise constant curvature, etc.},

  abstract  = {We derive a new exact stochastic particle flow for Bayes' rule using a theorem of Gromov. We also show numerical experiments for high dimensional problems up to d=100. The accuracy of our new filter is many orders of magnitude better than standard particle filters, and our filter beats the EKF by orders of magnitude for difficult nonlinear problems. The new theoretical result is valid for arbitrary smooth nowhere vanishing densities, whereas our previous theory was derived for the special case of Gaussian densities with linear measurements. It is crucial to mitigate stiffness of the flow in order to achieve good numerical results.},

@article{Dai2021,
  abstract = {In this paper, we are interested in obtaining answers to the following
              questions for particle flow filters: Can we provide a theoretical guarantee
              that particle flow filters give correct results such as unbiased estimates? Are
              particle flows stable and under what conditions? Can we have one particle flow
              filter, rather than multiple seemingly different ones? To answer these
              questions, we first derive a parameterized family of stochastic particle flow
              filters, in which particle flows are driven by a linear combination of prior
              knowledge and measurement likelihood information. We then show that several
              particle flows existing in the literature are special cases of this family. We
              prove that the particle flows are unbiased under the assumption of linear
              measurement and Gaussian distributions, and that estimates constructed from the
              stochastic flows are consistent. We further establish several finite time
              stability concepts for this new family of stochastic particle flows. The
              results reported in this paper represent a significant development toward
              establishing a theoretical foundation for particle flow filters.},

  abstract  = {Range sensors are devices that capture the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the world from the viewpoint of the sensor, usually measuring the depth to the nearest surfaces. These measurements could be at a single point, across a scanning plane, or a full image with depth measurements at every point. The benefits of this range data is that a robot can be relatively certain where the real world is, relative to the sensor, thus allowing the robot to more reliably find navigable routes, avoid obstacles, grasp objects, act on industrial parts, etc. This chapter introduces the main representations for range data (point sets, triangulated surfaces, voxels), the main methods for extracting usable features from the range data (planes, lines, triangulated surfaces), the main sensors for acquiring it (Sect. 31.1 - stereo and laser triangulation and ranging systems), how multiple observations of the scene, for example, as if from a moving robot, can be registered (Sect. 31.3) and several indoor and outdoor robot applications where range data greatly simplifies the task (Sect. 31.4).},
