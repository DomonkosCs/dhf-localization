## Info
This repository contains a localization algorithm, capable of localizing a mobile robot with a differential drive on an occupancy grid map using LiDAR and odometry data. 
The initial pose of the robot is assumed to be known.
See [paper](paper.pdf) for theoretical details. 

This algorithm can either be used as a stand-alone python package, or inside the Robot Operating System by the wrapper provided in https://github.com/DomonkosCs/dhf_loc_ros.
